# Stimulus design
#
# The experiment consists of two phases in which different sets of 30 sec long natural movies will be presented:
#   - Phase 1 consists of two natural movies (i.e., movie01 and movie02) and a constant gray screen (i.e., movie00).
#   - Phase 2 consists of 50 natural movies (i.e., movie03-movie52) and a constant gray screen (i.e., movie00).
#
# Animals are assigned into two groups (A and B), each presented with the movies in different order.
# In both groups, a total of 230 movies will be presented for a total time of 115 min:
#   1. For group A:
#           - Phase 1:
#               - 50 presentations of movie01 (25 min)
#               - 10 presentations of movie00 (5 min)
#               - 50 alternations between movie01 and movie02 (25 min)
#               - 10 presentations of movie00 (5 min)
#
#           - Phase 2:
#               - 20 presentations of movie03 (10 min)
#               - 10 presentations of movie00 (5 min)
#               - 50 sequential presentations of movie03 to movie52 (25 min)
#               - 10 presentations of movie00 (5 min)
#               - 20 alternations between movie03 and movie52 (10 min)
#
#   2. For group B:
#           - Phase 1:
#               - 50 alternations between movie01 and movie02 (25 min)
#               - 10 presentations of movie00 (5 min)
#               - 50 presentations of movie01 (25 min)
#               - 10 presentations of movie00 (5 min)
#
#           - Phase 2:
#               - 20 presentations of movie03 (10 min)
#               - 10 presentations of movie00 (5 min)
#               - 50 presentations of movie52 (25 min)
#               - 10 presentations of movie00 (5 min)
#               - 20 alternations between movie03 and movie52 (10 min)
